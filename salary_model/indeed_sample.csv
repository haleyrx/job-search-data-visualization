We believe in excellence, humility, trust and inclusion, and every team member has a veto power on who we hire.We adopt a finance-first approach to machine learning research, and we do not indulge in blindly applying solutions to machine learning problems in other domains to finance. Core to our research philosophy is the need to place as little assumptions on how the world behaves as possible, but rather let the data speak for itself, and use mathematical rigor to understand what the data is truly saying.We are backed by Y Combinator, legendary Renaissance Technologies and First Round Capital co-founder Howard Morgan, and prominent tech VCs David Lee & Zal Bilimoria, to name but a few.Pit.AI Technologies is hiring a Mathematical Scientist. You'll be at the core of our effort to solve intelligence for investment management, and as such, you'll work very closely with the CEO/CTO to improve our current generation of AI-Quants.This role is an in-house mathematician role. As such, you'll be involved in formulating fundamental questions arising as part of the investment process as mathematical problems consistent with our research philosophy, and you'll be responsible for solving those mathematical problems. This role is central to our research efforts, and your output is expected to have a critical impact on our bottom line, both in the short term and in the long term.The ideal candidate typically loves (and is capable of) testing and proving complex theorems and conjectures of her/his own, but prefers industry over academia as she/he is eager and impatient to see the impact of her/his work in real-life. She/he never shies away from finding closed-form solutions to complex mathematical problems, but she/he can also gauge the merits of numerical methods as an alternative when appropriate. As much as this is not an engineering role, the ideal candidate should be able to write prototype-quality Python code to test found mathematical results.Pit.AI Technologies supports publications of methodological findings to top machine learning venues.We strongly encourage applicants to read our blog posts (http://bit.ly/2Jf97aV) prior to applying, in order to get acquainted with our research philosophy and some of our works.Requirements:Ph.D. / Post Doc in Maths from a top university or research group, with an emphasis on stochastic analysis, optimization, and/or functional analysis.Excellent graduate-level understanding of probability theory, stochastic analysis, functional analysis and optimization, as evidenced for instance by a French DEA in maths, or the Cambridge Part III, prior to your PhD in Maths.Strong intuition to guide the design of reasonable conjectures from the geometry of the problem and background knowledge prior to attempting any proof.No finance or machine learning experience is required.","Palo Alto, CA"

We also support new science and research and we engage with governments, management organizations, and NGOs to advance the global dialogue on ocean transparency.GFW processes a global database of vessel GPS positions, several terabytes in size, and applies machine learning models that infer each vesselÈs type and size as well as when they are likely fishing. GFW is now developing new models, both on these GPS positions and on satellite imagery, to fully reveal activity in the world's oceans. These models include object detection from global feeds of satellite radar and optical imagery, and models that infer, based on vessel behavior, illegal activity and unreported catch. We believe that these new models have the potential to dramatically change the way we monitor and manage the worldÈs oceans.We are looking for a data scientist to join our research and innovation team to help develop these models. This team works closely with external GFW academic partners to develop models and research, and also with the internal GFW engineering team to scale our methods and put them into production.The PositionWorking closely with the GFW technical teams, the data scientist will help organize data and build models to understand several global datasets that reveal human activity on the worldÈs oceans. The two key types of data are 1) vessel GPS data and 2) satellite imagery (both optical and radar). A strong ability to work in R or Python is required, as well as abilities to manipulate data in SQL.The ideal candidate will be excited about working with global data, and will have a high aptitude for learning new techniques. Although it is obviously helpful, we do not expect that you already have a deep knowledge of building models or our key programming languages; we do expect that you have the aptitude to develop these skills and knowledge, and that you are excited about revealing human activity across the global ocean using these tools. Global Fishing Watch values working quickly, innovating, and working collaboratively. Our entire team works remotely, so the ideal candidate is able to manage their own time and be effective with limited daily oversight. Finally, we are passionate about producing research and datasets that will make a difference in how we manage the worldÈs oceans.The exact projects the data scientist will focus on will depend on the candidate and other factors at GFW. Possible projects include:Helping the machine learning engineers build models to identify fishing vessels from satellite and optical imagery -- experience with remote sensing, and especially synthetic aperture radar -- is helpfulCombining vessel detections from imagery with vessel GPS detections to identify vessels that are not broadcasting their locationsDeveloping models to estimate pollution from ocean going vessels, including noise pollutionUsing vessel behavior to identify vessels that have an elevated risk of using forced labor or engaging in other illegal activityCombing vessel tracking data with animal telemetry data (gps devices that have been attached to sharks and tunas) to build models to identify the likely catch and bycatch of ocean going vesselsCollaborating with the GFW engineering team to automate models.Engaging with GFW Research Partners to develop these models and publish peer reviewed papers (the GFW Research Program has produced more than 20 academic papers, including many published at top journals)Write blogs and present public visualizationsJob RequirementsRequired Technical SkillsDemonstrated skills with Python or R, with preference for PythonStrong SQL skillsStrong mathematical capabilitiesDemonstrated abilities to understand and interpret large datasets, including strong statistical understandingRequired Team and Communication SkillsTeam player, willing to work, teach, learn with/to/from the GFW teamProactive mindset  enjoys and exhibits a high-degree of ownership of tasks and projectsComfortable working in a small but fast growing organizationExcellent communication skills  in person, phone, and, most important, writtenComfortable communicating with a wide range of individuals, including peers, juniors and senior level people, and government officials from multiple countriesIntellectually curious, forward thinking, willing to suggest / try new technologies and creative approaches to problemsAbility to work in a remote-only distributed team (in more than 5 different time zones)Helpful Skills, but can be learned on the jobGoogle Earth EngineDistributed computation, such as Apache Beam (preferred), or Hadoop, Spark, etc.TensorflowNeural networksKnowledge about marine science and human impacts on the oceanDocumenting all knowledge produced so it can be distributed among the organization and to the publicLocation: GFW has a distributed workforce, with employees all over the world.This position will require the individual to have a time zone that overlaps significantly with California and Buenos Aires, with strong preference for U.S.Pacific, Central, or Mountain time.Responsible to: Research & Innovation DirectorSalary or Compensation: Commensurate with experience.

Poise and an engaging, empathetic communication style based on natural warmth and enthusiasm is the key to achieving the goals of this job. The work involves driving toward results by enrolling the commitment and buy-in of others. While the job requires strong initiative and self-direction, results are only achieved with and through people. A sincere appreciation for people and how they are each uniquely motivated is the foundation for designing and implementing interactive communication and decision-making processes. Knowledge and skill in how to successfully influence and persuade others by understanding how their individual needs and motivations link to goals is essential. The job requires a high degree of _ÑÒselling_Ñ, whether of ideas and policies within the organization, or products or services in the marketplace. The job environment is fast paced and results oriented. While there is urgency to goal achievement, responsibility for the achievement of results needs to be shared and effectively delegated when necessary. Initiating projects and processes beyond established organization practices will often require training and developing others, and enlisting their support by using a _ÑÒselling_Ñ rather _ÑÒtelling_Ñ communication style. A self-confident, extroverted style that can enliven, engage and positively impact individuals and groups is essential. The job has variety of tasks and is dynamic and changing. Because goals and desired results can quickly change, the job requires regularly meeting and pro-actively establishing relationships with new groups. The ability to understand, quickly react and motivate others to adapt to the changing organization environment is a critical key to success. In general, the core of this position requires a motivated and motivating team builder and organization developer.Startup Life Primer:Audantic was recently ranked 968 on the INC. 5000 list of fastest growing companies.
